Key Notes:
---------
- I have used vite instead of the traditional create react app which is a drastic update. (USE 'npm run dev' instead of 'npm start')
  ~ So no more Happy Hacking.
- I used MobX stores as an OOP approach to organize the code.
- I did not use typescript because I did not want to manually provide the 'types' and for the error control, I did not need to autocheck the errors.
- Semantic UI has been used here because I wanted to increase the pace of my work.
- I created a Single Window App instead since it is a small function.

---------
Important
---------
- The registration and login has been merged into one. So when you type in the email, the JWT token gets authenticated and you will be logged in.

Work Update
-----------
- The delete and edit portions are yet to be integrated. I have office work, so I am doing it on my free time.
